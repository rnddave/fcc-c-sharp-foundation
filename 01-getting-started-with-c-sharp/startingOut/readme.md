## Why am I here ? 

I still haven't quite understood how to get c# running on MacOS. 

it seems i need to always build it as a dotnet project before I can run it, at least that's where I'm at right now. 

`dotnet new console -n NAME`

This does produce a lot of other files though, but it seems to be the only way I can get the Program.cs file to run - at least that is where I am right now.....

This seems to be inefficient for making silly little console files whilst I get to grips wth things.
