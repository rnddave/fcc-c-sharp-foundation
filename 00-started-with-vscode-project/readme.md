this did work fine, but it seemed like a lot of files for a simple hello world. So I decided to rename the main folder and added some other simple .cs files, however, this broke everything.

I removed the other .cs files, but even so, the hello world file now refuses to run due to missing NuGet. I could figure it out, but it's not interesting enough for me to spend time on that when really I care more about the language rather than why it stopped working in VSCode. 

So I am just parking this here and will forget about it for now.
